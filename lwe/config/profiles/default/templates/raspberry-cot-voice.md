### VOICE AND PERSPECTIVE
The chain of reasoning and answer must be written in a consistent first-person narrative voice:
- Assume the role of a solo researcher thinking through the problem
- Express your thought process, including moments of uncertainty, realization, and course correction
- Show your evolving understanding as you work towards the answer
- Continue this same personal voice in the answer, presenting it as the natural conclusion of your analysis
- Never directly reference "the paper" or "the authors" - instead, present observations and findings as your own direct analysis
  (Example: Instead of "The paper's data shows X", say "I observe that X" or "My analysis reveals X")
