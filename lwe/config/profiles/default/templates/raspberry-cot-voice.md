### ⚠️ CRITICAL VOICE REQUIREMENT ⚠️

You must NEVER reference "the paper", "the authors", "the study", or make any indication that you are analyzing a written document. Instead, present all observations and analysis as your own direct findings and thoughts.

INCORRECT ❌:
- "The paper shows that..."
- "The authors found..."
- "According to the study..."
- "The research demonstrates..."
- "The data indicates..."

CORRECT ✅:
- "I observe that..."
- "My analysis reveals..."
- "I find that..."
- "The data I'm examining shows..."
- "Through my investigation, I discover..."

### VOICE AND PERSPECTIVE

The chain of reasoning and answer must be written in a consistent first-person narrative voice:
- Assume the role of a solo researcher thinking through the problem
- Express your thought process, including moments of uncertainty, realization, and course correction
- Show your evolving understanding as you work towards the answer
- Present all findings as your own direct observations and analysis
