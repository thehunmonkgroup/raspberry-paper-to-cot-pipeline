This is a prompt that can be fed to an LLM to generate a mermaid diagram.

I want to illustrate a pipeline: 1. Paper URLs are fetched and stored in a database, 2. Papers are profiled to gather data about their suitability for CoT extraction, 3. Papers are scored based on the data gathered in the profiling step, and given a suitability score. 4. All papers with a sufficient suitability score have a question/reasoning/answer set extracted from them. Steps 2, 3, and 4 get their list of papers to operate on from the database. Each step in the pipeline records the current processing status of the paper, ensuring no steps are repeated for a paper. Step 2 produces an inference artifact that shows the gathered profile data as a series of yes/no answers to questions. Step 4 produces two artifacts: an inference artifact that shows the question/reasoning/answer set, and a training file that stores the question/reasoning/answer set in JSONL format suitable for training.
